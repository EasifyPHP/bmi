# Contributing to EasifyPHP Template

First off, thank you for considering contributing to EasifyPHP Template! It's people like you that make EasifyPHP such a
great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or
approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork EasifyPHP Template and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #123 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature-123-noticeable-change
```

## Code your changes

This part is up to you! Make your changes and make sure to adhere to the PHP coding standards as much as possible.

## Testing

After you've done your changes, make sure to run the tests. If you've added a new feature, it's your responsibility to
write tests for it. For bugs, adding a failing test could be enough.

```bash
composer run test
```

## Submitting your changes

Once you feel your changes are ready, don't forget to run the test suite and ensure all tests pass. Then, push your
changes to your fork on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature-123-noticeable-change
```

## Creating a pull request

Go to your fork on GitHub and then hit the 'New pull request' button and provide a general description of your changes
in the pull request form.

## What's next?

Well, that's it! Thank you for your contribution. We'll review your pull request as soon as possible. We may suggest
some changes or improvements.

Again, thank you for contributing! We're excited to see what you've got for us!
